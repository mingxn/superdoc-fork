 * Visual Regression Testing:
 * This CSS isolation is critical for protecting editor content from external stylesheets.
 * Visual regression tests should be added to the visual testing repository to ensure:
 * 1. Text content is not affected by aggressive global CSS
 * 2. SVG shapes (shape groups, vector shapes) render correctly
 * 3. No visual regressions when client applications have conflicting styles
 *
 * Reference: PR #1219 - "improve style scoping in the editor to prevent external styles affecting content"
 * Reference: PR #1236 - "shape groups" (this fix ensures both isolation AND SVG rendering work)
